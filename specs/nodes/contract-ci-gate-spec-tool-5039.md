title: Graph-aware PR gate as a tools/spec.ts subcommand

## Problem interpretation

The intent (`intent-ci-enforcement-gates-5c90`) wants GitHub Actions to
enforce, on every PR, that the spec graph stays trustworthy (schema valid,
indexes not drifted) and that code changes carry evidence — unless a human
signs an override. The load-bearing piece is `pr-evidence`: it must read the
`edges.yaml` diff and decide pass/fail using graph *semantics* — an added
`evidences` edge only counts if its target brief `decomposes` a contract
that is `approved`. That is exactly the node/edge resolution `tools/spec.ts`
already performs for `spec:index`/`spec:validate`. This candidate puts the
decision where the graph model already lives: a new `spec:gate` subcommand.
Workflows stay thin shims that call pnpm scripts. The schema migration lands
first so everything else can reference `override`/`waives`.

Shared reading of the schema migration: `override` node type with
required_fields exactly `[id, type, title, reason, approved_by, expires]`
(the intent's list — no `status`, like `decision`; `created` permitted but
not required) and a `waives` edge type. A named check (`pr-evidence`) is not
a node, so this candidate teaches `spec:validate` a small allowlist of check
names that a `waives` target may resolve to instead of a node.

## Scope

- **Schema migration (first commit).**
  - `node-types.yaml`: add `override` (required_fields above,
    `requires_body: true`, no status enum).
  - `edge-types.yaml`: add `waives` (source `override`; target a node *or* a
    named check from the allowlist).
  - Register a check-name allowlist `[ci, spec-index, spec-validate,
    pr-evidence]`; a `waives` edge to one of these is valid and exempt from
    node-resolution, any other `waives` target resolves to a node as usual.
  - Extend `tools/spec.ts` validate to accept the new types and the
    allowlist rule; `by-type.yaml` automatically gains an `override:` group.
- **`spec:gate` subcommand** in `tools/spec.ts` + `package.json` script
  `"spec:gate": "tsx tools/spec.ts gate"`. Given a base ref (env `GATE_BASE`,
  default the PR base): run `git diff <base>...HEAD -- specs/graph/edges.yaml
  specs/nodes/`, parse the *added* edges/nodes, fold them into the existing
  graph model, and pass iff **either** (a) an added `evidences` edge whose
  target brief `decomposes` a contract with `status: approved`, **or** (b) an
  added `override` node together with an added `waives` edge whose target is
  the named check `pr-evidence`. Non-zero exit with a human-readable reason.
- **Workflows (`.github/workflows/`), thin:**
  - `ci.yml` — every PR: `pnpm install`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`,
    `pnpm lint`.
  - `spec-index.yml` — every PR: `pnpm spec:index`, then
    `git diff --exit-code specs/indexes/`.
  - `spec-validate.yml` — PRs touching `specs/**`: `pnpm spec:validate`.
  - `pr-evidence.yml` — PRs, `paths-ignore` skipping PRs that touch only
    `specs/**` or `docs/**`: `fetch-depth: 0` checkout, `pnpm spec:gate` with
    base = `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`.
- **`lint` toolchain.** No linter exists today; add a minimal one (e.g.
  eslint flat config + a `"lint"` script) so `ci.yml`'s lint step is real.
- **`.github/CODEOWNERS`**: `/specs/schema/ @<reviewer>` and
  `/specs/nodes/contract-* @<reviewer>`. The intent left the handle
  truncated (`@`), so the implementer must confirm the real GitHub handle.

## Non-scope

- No change to existing lifecycle node/edge semantics beyond adding
  `override`/`waives`.
- No branch-protection configuration in code — that is repo-admin settings
  (a documented manual step; the workflows only emit pass/fail).
- No new lifecycle commands or skills.

## Trade-offs

- **+** Reuses the existing js-yaml parsing and in-memory graph model; the
  2-hop `evidences → brief → approved-contract` check is a few lines against
  a model that already resolves edges, not bespoke YAML scraping.
- **+** One source of truth for graph semantics: `spec:validate` and
  `spec:gate` share the loader, so the gate cannot drift from what
  validation considers a well-formed graph.
- **+** Runnable locally (`pnpm spec:gate`) before pushing; unit-testable via
  the existing `node --test` harness.
- **−** Grows `tools/spec.ts` with a new concern it never had: awareness of
  git diffs and a base ref. The tool stops being a pure function of the
  working tree.
- **−** Adds public surface (`spec:gate`) to keep stable and documented.
- **−** The check-name allowlist is a special case in validation — a small
  wart to remember when reasoning about `waives` targets.

## Risks

- **Base-ref correctness in CI.** A shallow checkout or wrong base SHA makes
  the diff empty and the gate falsely pass/fail. Mitigation: `fetch-depth: 0`
  and pass `pull_request.base.sha` explicitly; gate errors loudly if the base
  ref is unresolvable.
- **Diff vs. merged-state mismatch.** "Added edges" from a diff can disagree
  with the true merge result under concurrent base changes. Mitigation:
  compute against the PR merge base; re-run on rebase.
- **Allowlist staleness.** A renamed check leaves a `waives` target
  accepted-but-meaningless. Mitigation: the allowlist is the single registry;
  validate errors on `waives` to an unknown name.

## Acceptance examples

1. **Schema first.** After the migration commit, `pnpm spec:validate` is
   green, `override`/`waives` appear in the schema, and an `override` group
   exists in `specs/indexes/by-type.yaml`.
2. **Blocked without evidence.** A PR editing code (`tools/*.ts`) with no
   `evidences` edge fails `pr-evidence.yml` (`pnpm spec:gate` non-zero) with
   a message naming the missing evidence.
3. **Unblocked by evidence.** A PR whose `edges.yaml` diff adds an
   `evidences` edge whose target brief `decomposes` an `approved` contract
   passes `pr-evidence.yml`.
4. **Unblocked by override.** A PR adding an `override` node (with `reason`)
   plus a `waives` edge targeting named check `pr-evidence` passes
   `pr-evidence.yml`, and the override id is listed under `by-type: override`
   in `specs/indexes/by-type.yaml`.
5. **Index drift caught.** A PR hand-editing `specs/indexes/by-type.yaml`
   without regenerating fails `spec-index.yml` on `git diff --exit-code`.
6. **Skips.** A docs-only or specs-only PR does not run `pr-evidence.yml`.

## Verification needs

- A scratch-branch PR per acceptance example (2–6), observing the relevant
  check red/green.
- `node --test` cases for `spec:gate`: synthetic edges/nodes diffs exercising
  both pass clauses and the no-evidence fail.
- `pnpm spec:validate` green on the real tree after the migration and after
  an override+waives pair is added.
- Confirm the CODEOWNERS handle and that branch protection marks
  `pr-evidence` a required check (documented step).
